##Data

Graphs are taken from TSPLIB: 

http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/

Input files have been modified a little bit compared to the original.
At the beginning we have written the number of nodes.
At the end of each file we have written the length of the optimal path.

Graphs are stored in the "data" folder of this repository.
